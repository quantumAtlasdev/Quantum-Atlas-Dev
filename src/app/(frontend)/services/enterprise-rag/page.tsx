      a: 'PostgreSQL already handles your operational data. Adding pgvector, ParadeDB, and Apache AGE means no additional vendor, no additional cost, no additional operational complexity, and no data leaving a system you already trust. Our retrieval quality matches or beats standalone vector databases for enterprise document search.',

      a: 'We have tested against corpora of 100,000+ documents. Performance depends on your hardware. On a standard 16-core server with 64GB RAM, query latency is under 2 seconds for corpora up to 500,000 chunks.',
