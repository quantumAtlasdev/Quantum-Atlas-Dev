    {
      q: 'What types of processes are good candidates for automation?',
      a: 'Processes that: repeat frequently, follow defined rules, involve data movement between systems, require document processing, or involve notifications and approvals. Poor candidates: one-off tasks, highly creative work, relationship-dependent decisions.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How is LangGraph different from a simple chatbot or Zapier flow?',
      a: 'LangGraph handles stateful, multi-step processes with branching logic. An agent can collect information across multiple turns, make decisions based on context, call external tools, handle errors gracefully, and resume interrupted processes. Zapier cannot do any of this.',
    },
    {
      q: 'We use Tally for accounting — can you integrate with it?',
      a: 'Yes. We have built Tally ETL pipelines for internal use. We can extract data from Tally, transform it for your downstream systems, and push structured data back into Tally.',

    {
      q: 'What are MCP servers and why do you mention safety gates?',
      a: 'Model Context Protocol servers let AI agents call tools and access external systems. Safety gates are approval steps, rate limits, and permission checks that ensure the AI only does what it is supposed to. Enterprise AI automation requires this — you do not want an agent with unchecked access to your database.',

    {
      q: 'How do you document the automations you build?',
