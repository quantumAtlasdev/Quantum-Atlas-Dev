  faqs: [
    {
      q: 'What document types do you support?',
      a: 'Invoices, KYC documents, bills of entry, bills of lading, shipping certificates, contracts, purchase orders, bank statements, medical records, property documents, tax forms, and more. If we have not processed your document type, we fine-tune a model for it.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How accurate is the extraction?',
      a: 'Accuracy depends on document quality and type. For standard structured documents (invoices, KYC), we achieve 97–99% field-level accuracy after fine-tuning. We provide confidence scores on every extraction so your systems can route low-confidence results for human review.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can it handle handwritten documents?',
      a: 'Yes, with limitations. Printed documents achieve near-perfect accuracy. Handwritten documents depend on quality — we use GLM OCR which handles most handwriting, but accuracy varies. We test on your actual document corpus before quoting accuracy targets.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How does contract intelligence work?',
      a: 'We extract structured data from contracts — parties, dates, obligations, payment terms, termination clauses, liability caps, IP ownership, and custom fields you define. The system flags unusual clauses against a baseline, tracks deadlines, and lets you query the entire contract corpus via RAG.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What happens with confidential documents?',
      a: 'With on-premise deployment, documents never leave your servers. With our managed cloud, documents are processed and deleted — we do not store your document content. We sign NDAs and data processing agreements as required.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How long does integration take?',
      a: '6–8 weeks for a standard deployment including document type configuration, fine-tuning, and ERP/CRM integration. Simpler single-document-type deployments can be done in 3–4 weeks.',
